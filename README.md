# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! The purpose of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate my data science skills through some of my past projects and research.
- Provide documentation of my work for those interested.
- Track my progress as I navigate the field.

As I add to this portfolio, you can expect to find my projects sorted into different stages. These may include:
- **Exploratory data analysis**, such as data cleaning methods and basic summary statistics.
- **Statistical models**, ranging from linear regression to more advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Data visualizations**, such as key figures, posters, or interactive dashboards.
