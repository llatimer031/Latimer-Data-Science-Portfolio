# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! The purpose of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate my data science skills through some of my past projects and research.
- Provide documentation of my work for those interested.
- Track my progress as I navigate the field.

The projects in this portfolio will demonstrate skills across several stages of data analysis. These may include:
- **Exploratory data analysis**, such as basic summary statsitcs, data cleaning methods, and tidy data techniques.
- **Statistical models**, ranging from basic linear regression to more advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Data visualizations**, such as key figures, posters, or interactive dashboards.

Some current projects you can find in my portfolio are:
- [Basic Streamlit App](https://github.com/llatimer031/Latimer-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app): Uses sample data to learn basic commands in Streamlit, including...
  - Formatting, such as page set-up, titles and headers, and how to write text to appear in the app.
  - Interactive widgets, such as selectbox, radio, and slider, which allow users to manually input settings that modify the data.
- [Machine Learning Streamlit App](https://github.com/llatimer031/Latimer-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp): Uses concepts from the basic streamlit app to explore how supervised learning models react to unique data and settings. Interactive choices include...
  - The option to upload and process datasets, or use sample data that is pre-processed.
  - The ability to explore two classification models (logistic regression and kNN) and compare their performaces.
  - Widgets to adjust or select hyperparameters that may affect model performance. 
- [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/llatimer031/Latimer-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project): Uses the principles of tidy data to prepare a 'messy' dataset for analysis, which is a process needed at the start of almost any data science project. Concepts covered include...
  - The reformatting and melting of data frames to produce and store variables properly.
  - The exploration of pivot tables to aggregate data.
