# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! The purpose of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate my data science skills through some of my past projects and research.
- Provide documentation of my work for those interested.
- Track my progress as I navigate the field.

The projects in this portfolio should demonstrate skills across several stages of data analysis. These may include:
- **Exploratory data analysis**, such as basic summary statsitcs, data cleaning methods, and tidy data techniques.
- **Statistical models**, ranging from linear regression to more advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Data visualizations**, such as key figures, posters, or interactive dashboards.

Some current projects you can find in my portfolio are:
- [Basic Streamlit App](https://github.com/llatimer031/Latimer-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app), demonstrating my ability to interact with data via a Streamlit platform, adding to my data visualization toolkit. 
- [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/llatimer031/Latimer-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project), which requires the principles of tidy data to be applied to a 'messy' dataset, promoting effective data cleaning techniques to be used on future datasets.
