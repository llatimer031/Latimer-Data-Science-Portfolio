# Data Science Portfolio

## Overview:
Welcome to my data science portfolio! The purpose of this repository is to:
- Demonstrate my data science skills through some of my past projects and research.
- Provide documentation of my work for those interested.
- Track my progress as I navigate the field.

The projects in this portfolio will demonstrate skills across several stages of data analysis. These may include:
- **Exploratory data analysis**, such as basic summary statsitcs, data cleaning methods, and tidy data techniques.
- **Statistical models**, ranging from basic linear regression to more advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Data visualizations**, such as key figures, posters, or interactive dashboards.

## Portfolio at a Glance:

### Basic Streamlit App
This application uses sample data to learn basic commands in Streamlit, including:
- Formatting, such as page set-up, titles and headers, and how to write text to appear in the app.
- Interactive widgets, such as selectbox, radio, and slider, which allow users to manually input settings that modify the data.

This app was my introduction to coding with the Streamlit package, and would eventually serve as a basis for more complex machine learning apps later in my portfolio.

### Tidy Data Project
This project uses the principles of tidy data to prepare a 'messy' dataset for analysis, which is a process needed at the start of almost any data science project. Concepts covered include:
- Violations to the Tidy Data principles and approaches to resolving these issues.
- The reformatting and melting of data frames to produce and store variables properly.
- The exploration of pivot tables to aggregate data.

This experience reinforced that effective data analysis begins with careful, well-structured preprocessing, which is an insight that I believe is critical in the process of becoming a data scientist.

### Supervised Learning Streamlit App
This machine learning app uses concepts from the basic streamlit app to explore how supervised learning models respond to different datasets and parameters. Specifically, it focuses on training and tuning two types of classification models, logistic regression and k Nearest Neighbors. Interactive choices include:
- The option to upload and process datasets, or use sample data that is pre-processed.
- The ability to choose between the two model types and compare their performaces.
- Widgets to adjust or select hyperparameters that may affect model performance.

This project advanced my Streamlit skills as I sought thoughtful and effective ways to share machine learning processes with others. It also furthered my understanding of model training, preparation, and performance evaluation.

### Unsupervised Learning Streamlit App
This machine learning app explores unsupervised learning techniques across different datasets and parameters. Model choices include clustering methods such as kMeans and hierarchical clustering, but dimension reduction techniques such as PCA are also explored throughout the app. Other interactive choices include:
- The option to upload and process datasets, or use sample data that is pre-processed.
- The choice to fit either of the clustering techniques to the data.
- Widgets to find optimal number of clusters, iterations, or linkage types.

This final project in my portfolio was an opportunity to showcase the skills I have developed over the course of the semester, combining careful pre-processing skills, advanced machine learning techniques, and creating user-friendly interfaces to build my application.

## Next Steps:
Following the conclusion of this course, I plan to continue to implement data science into my work and build further on the skills showcased in this portfolio.
