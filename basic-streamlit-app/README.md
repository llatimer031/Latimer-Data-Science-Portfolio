# Interactive Streamlit App 
This is a basic Streamlit app which focuses on the use of interactive widgets to explore and subset data.

## Data:
This app uses data found in the [Palmer's Penguins CSV](https://github.com/llatimer031/Latimer-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/basic-streamlit-app/data/penguins.csv).

## Usage:
Follow these steps to use the Streamlit app:

   (e.g. cd path/to/basic_streamlit_app)
2. **Launch the interface using the following command:**  
   streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py
3. **Interact with the app:** The app will open in a separate web browser. Use the provided widgets to indicate preferences regarding location, species, and size. View a subset of the data with the specified characteristics. Adjust your selections at any point to produce a different subset.
