# Interactive Streamlit App 
This is a basic Streamlit app which reads the [Palmer's Penguins data](https://github.com/llatimer031/Latimer-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/basic-streamlit-app/data/penguins.csv) and allows users to interactively explore the data. 

**Launch the interface from your terminal using the following command:**  
streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py  
(Note: direct yourself to the folder containing the basic_streamlit_app before running)

After running, the app will open in a separate web browser. The user will indicate a series of preferences regarding location, species, and size that yeild a subset of the data with the specified characteristics. Preferences can be changed at any point to produce different subsets.
