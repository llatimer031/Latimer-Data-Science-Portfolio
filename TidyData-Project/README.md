## Project Overview: 
The goal of this project was to utilize tidy data principles during the data cleaning processes to produce data sets that were readily able to be visualized and manipulated. Much of the data analysis process is spent in the cleaning stages, as it neccessary to ensure that the data can be further tested and analyzed. Thus, it is important that cleaning techniques are done as effectively and efficiently as possible to make for smoother analysis down the road. Tidy data approaches, like the ones explored in this project, are an important aspect to doing so. 

## Data:
This project uses data modified from a [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2019/2019-02-12) repository on Federal Research and Discovery Spending by Agency. The modified data can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/llatimer031/Latimer-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/TidyData-Project/data/fed_rd_year%26gdp.csv).

## Instructions and Usage:
1. **Esnure the proper requirements are installed:**
- Python (version 3.12 or greater recommended)
- A system capable of running Jupyter Notebook (e.g. Jupyter Lab, VS Code, or a cloud environment like Google Colab)
- The required Python libraries (i.e. pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot)
  
2. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone https://github.com/llatimer031/Latimer-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project
   
3. **Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:**
- Load the system of your choosing and navigate to the cloned repository. 
- Open the main.ipynb file.
- Run sequentially.
